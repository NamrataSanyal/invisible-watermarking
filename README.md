# invisible-watermarking
An implementation of two invisible watermarking schemes using python.

To run the codes please run 'git clone https://github.com/nilesh-sengupta/invisible-watermarking.git' with the latest version of git pre-installed.

cd invisible-watermarking

To open jupyter notebook run 'jupyter notebook' in the terminal
Navigate to 'das et al' and open das.ipynb to run the scheme from das et al(2017)
To view the scaling attack use dasScaled.ipynb

To open jupyter notebook run 'jupyter notebook' in the terminal
Navigate to 'lin et al' and open lin.ipynb to run the scheme from lin et al(2009)
NB: The code lin_scaled.ipynb includes the scaling attack performed

To compare results using PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), use 'psnr.ipynb' from 'tests' after placing the original and compressed images in the folder 'tests'

'images' contains the host images and a few watermarks used during experimentation
